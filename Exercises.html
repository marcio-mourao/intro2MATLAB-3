%% *Exercise #4 - More exercises on matrices*
% **
% 
% *A magic square is a square matrix which has the special properties that 
% if you take the sum along any row, column or either main diagonal, you get the 
% same result.*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.1     Open a new script in the Editor. The first line should create 
% a magic square of size 3, using the magic function as follows: A = magic(3). 
% Save the script as matrices.m, and run the script.*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.2     Add lines to the script to verify that the rows, columns and main 
% diagonal of the square add up to the same number using sum and diag. Use help 
% and doc to understand these functions.*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.3     Add lines using repmat to tile A four times vertically and two 
% times horizontally, assigning the output to B (B = repmat(A,...)).*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.4     Check the row, column and diagonal sums of B.*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.5     Replicate B, one time vertically and two times horizontally, assigning 
% the output to C. Is C magic?*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.6     After running the script created so far, look at the elements 
% of A, B and C in the Command Window (type in the variable name and press Enter).*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.7     The original magic square (A) can be extracted from C using sequential 
% indexing. Try it, assigning the output to (D).*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.8    Add a line to verify that D is equal to A using isequal.*
% 
% **
% 
% *4.9    The elements of A can also be extracted from C using linear indexing, 
% taking every 4th value starting from 1 and ending at a suitable number to extract 
% 9 elements in total. Try this and assign the output to E. Consider how you could 
% convert E into the original magic square form and test this in your script.*

%% *Exercise #5 - Strings, Cell Arrays and Structures*
% **
% 
% *5.1    Create a variable A whose value is the string ‘hello’.*
% 
% *5.2    Create a cell array B containing the strings: ‘hello’ ‘goodbye’ 
% ‘hello’ ‘hello goodbye’ ‘goodbye’ ‘hello’ ‘goodhellow’. Each index in your cell 
% array should contain one of these strings.  Note, you can create an empty cell 
% array by setting it to an empty cell, e.g. B| = {}; |and you can add a string 
% to the end of a cell array by e.g. B|{end+1} = 'hello';*|
% 
% *5.3    Create a structure C with two fields named 'field1' and 'field2'. 
% Assign them with any string you want and a 2x2 matrix of random values. Now, 
% change the matrix from the structure to [1 2;3 4]*
%% **
%% *Exercise #6 - Functions*
% **
% 
% *6.1     Write a function file that converts temperature in degrees Fahrenheit 
% (F) to degrees Centigrade (C). Recall the conversion formulation, C = 5/9 * 
% (F - 32). Convert to C, 32F and 100F.*
% 
% **
% 
% *6.2    Write a function file, with two input and two output arguments, 
% that determines the height in centimeters (cm) and mass in kilograms (kg) of 
% a person from his height in inches (in) and weight in pounds (lb).*
% 
% **
% 
% *    6.2.1    Determine in SI units the height and mass of a 5 ft.15 in. 
% person who weight 180 lb.*
% 
% *    6.2.2    Determine your own height and weight in SI units.*
% 
% **
%% *Exercise #7 - Files*
% **
% 
% *7.1    Create two magic squares of size five and ten and save them to 
% two separate MAT files named magic5.mat and magic10.mat, respectively.*
% 
% *7.2    Clear the original magic square variables and then reload them 
% from the MAT files using load. Confirm that the reloaded variables are the expected 
% magic squares.*
% 
% *7.3    Using xlswrite in the following form: xlswrite(filename,A,sheet,range) 
% (where A is the matrix to be written and the other variables are strings; read 
% the doc examples), write the small magic square to an excel spreadsheet called 
% magic.xls, starting at cell C2, and naming the sheet magic5.*
% 
% *7.4    Write the large magic square to a second worksheet in the same 
% file called magic10, starting from cell B3.*
% 
% *7.5    Open the spreadsheet in Excel (outside MATLAB) to confirm it has 
% written correctly.*
% 
% *7.6    Use xlsfinfo to check the format of the excel file, and the names 
% of the worksheets. Clear the magic square variables from the workspace and read 
% them back in from the Excel spreadsheet using xlsread to read the magic squares 
% back into MATLAB.*
